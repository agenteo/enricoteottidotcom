<h2 id="content">Let's set us up for the best possible outcome!</h2>

<span class="image fit"><img src="{% link assets/images/project-kickoff-best-outcome.jpg %}" alt="" /></span>

<p>Based on many awful kickoffs--and many awesome ones--I was part of I want to set us up for the best possible outcome. My routine before the project kickoff is pretty structured:</p>

<ol>
    <li>I will collect expectations from key participants</li>    
    <li>I will craft an invitation that is <strong>clear and meningful to all</strong></li>
    <li>I will design a supple agenda and activities to get us from A to B.</li>
</ol>

<p>Session structure is not a guarantee for perfection. Its design is supple so it can withstand some uncertainty emerging on the day.</p>

<h2 id="content">Why choose me?</h2>

<p>Since 2001 I worked around the globe in the IT world, but that is just a number. I've gone trough a journey from developer to product manager to facilitator so now:</p>
<ul>
        <li>I have empathy for software developers</li>
        <li>I have empathy for the business side</li>
        <li>and with my facilitation skills I can help the group get past what seems like a trecherous journey.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="content">Yes it works online</h2>

<p>I worked remotely on and off since 2007. I am pretty skilled with all the latest online tools.</p>
<ul>
        <li>I will assess are adeguate for your group context (skillset, bandwith, timezones)</li>
        <li>I have a state of the art office with: large monitor, backup internet and power so I can provide some redundancy.</li>
</ul>
