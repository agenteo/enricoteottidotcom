At the start of the pandemic IAF had all english speaking chapters around Europe and North America moving their meetings online. I proposed to create a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.iaf-world.org/site/chapters/online-facilitation-0">special interest group</a> for all IAF members and friends to meet and improve our online facilitation.

The monthly session can run as a lean coffee (1 hour) or with a designated facilitator (2 hours). Usually the IAF social post specify that. What's the difference?


## Lean coffee style

When we do not have a designated facilitator the meeting lasts 1 hour, run as a lean coffee to share and learn about  **impactful online facilitation ideas, activities or tools**.

## With a Designated Facilitator

When we have a volunteer facilitator the meeting lasts 2h. The facilitator comes up with an interactive online session idea to facilitate. **If you have an idea fill in the form!**

<a target="_blank" href="{{ site.iaf_online_sig_registration_url }}" class="button icon fa-sign-in">Join the next call</a>

The designated facilitator should:
* interactively share a topic, activity, workshop for about 1h30m
* practice online facilitation
* share interactively experience reports of what worked and didn't work
