<h2 id="content">How effective are your Agile Retrospectives today?</h2>

<h3 id="content">Would you like to make them even more effective?</h3>

<p>I can help design, facilitate or co-faciltiate. I follow a structure that allows the whole group to participate, bring in data, reflect and foster divergent thinking and come to a conclusion on what to do next.</p>

<h3 id="content">Purpose of an Agile Retrospective</h3>

<ul>
    <li>to share information--not just data--in a psycologically safe environment (it's not a blaming session)</li>
    <li>to dedicate time and reflect--fostering divergent thinking--on what happened then adjust to work more effectively</li> 
</ul>

<h3 id="content">Outcome of an Agile Retrospective</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Insights on what happened</li>
    <li>Actionable experiments</li>
    <li>Renewed energy to go in to the next iteration</li>
</ul>

<p>You don't have to be using any Agile framework to benefit from the learnings of an Agile Retrospective!</p>
